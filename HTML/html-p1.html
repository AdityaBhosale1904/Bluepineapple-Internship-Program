   <h1>Camelids</h1>
    <p>The four llamas and two camels are camelids. Camelids tend to be large and are 
    strictly herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. 
    They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; 
    an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an 
    isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that,
    because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still. (from Wikipedia) </p>
